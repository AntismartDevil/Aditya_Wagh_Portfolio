## About

Hi, I’m Aditya, a passionate Game Designer and Developer, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I specialize in game development, interactive storytelling, and creating immersive gaming experiences. I have hands-on experience with game mechanics, level design, and using various game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. Additionally, I am proficient in C#, C++, and Python, and have worked on multiple game development projects, both academic and personal.

I’m excited about leveraging my technical skills in programming and game design to create captivating experiences for players. I also have a strong interest in machine learning and AI, which I aim to incorporate into my future game design projects. My journey includes video streaming as a content creator, where I engage with an audience of over 10 lakh views and share gaming experiences through live streams and YouTube videos.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new game mechanics, designing levels, and creating interactive narratives for future games.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will briefly describe game development projects, technologies I used, and the skills applied to create engaging and immersive experiences.
## Image Classifier with TensorFlow and Streamlit
- Goal: Build an image classification web app to predict images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (CIFAR-10 dataset).
- Code: GitHub Link
- Description: Developed a web application using Streamlit and TensorFlow to classify images into 10 categories, such as airplane, automobile, and dog. The app allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from the model.
- Skills: Image preprocessing, TensorFlow model deployment, UI/UX design, user interaction.
- Technology: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, NumPy, PIL.
- Results: Achieved real-time image classification with high accuracy and a user-friendly interface.
## Game Design
